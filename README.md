# Basic Configs

Some basic unix-y config files that I like; some patchworked together, some hand-made.

## Installing

1. ```git clone https://github.com/sbassett29/basic-configs.git```
2. ```cd basic-configs && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh```

**OR**

1. Just curl the files you'd like, e.g. ```bashrc```:
... 
...```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbassett29/basic-configs/master/bashrc -o ~/.bashrc```
